# Firebase By Example
This repository can help you with basic Firebase introduction.
You can follow my blog post here: 
You can use this code as a template, create your own Firebase project, add your firebase configuration in public/main.js and see how the different Firebase features work.

You can also checkout the deployed webpage as my Firebase app in here: fir-by-example.firebaseapp.com
To see the relevant part of code that uses a feature you can click the info icon next to every title.
Some features will not work due to security restrictions I applied (running on the free tier).
