# Firebase By Example
This repository can help you with basic Firebase introduction.
You can follow my blog post here: 
The post has 2 parts, one is more of an explanation of Firebase and the other is a more practical guide describing what this code does.
Use this code as a template, create your own Firebase project, add your firebase configuration in public/main.js and see how the different Firebase features work.

You can also checkout the deployed webpage as my Firebase app in here: fir-by-example.firebaseapp.com
